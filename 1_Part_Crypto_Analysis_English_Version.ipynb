WebDriver initialization and configuration.\nAt the beginning of the code, the browser is configured using Selenium WebDriver.\nThe options --disable-infobars, --disable-popup-blocking, and other parameters help prevent pop-up windows that may interfere with the scraping process.\nThe headless mode (commented out) allows the browser to run without a graphical interface, which is useful for background or server-side tasks.\n\n2. Loading the web page and creating a BeautifulSoup object.\nThe page with comments on Investing.com is opened, and its HTML code is saved for further analysis.\n\n3. Retrieving the maximum page number.\nThe total number of pages (page_max) is determined using the navigation buttons. The last button on the page contains the maximum page number, which is converted to an integer.\n\n4. Parsing comments on each page.\nThis is where the main loop starts, which:\n- Collects comments from the current page\n- Navigates to the next page until the end or until the required conditions are met\n- Processes comments\n- For each comment, the following fields are extracted: comment text (by locating the corresponding div), comment date (by extracting the date text), and an additional feature — the number of likes extracted from the comment\n- Timestamp validation. During parsing, the script checks how much time has passed since the comment was published. If a comment is older than 1 year (365 days), the parsing process is terminated early (the current page is set to the last page and the loop is exited).\n- If parsing is not finished and comments for the last year have not yet been fully collected, after processing the current page the script navigates to the next page using the \"Next\" button via Selenium. After the click, the browser is given time to load the new page.\n\n5. Termination of the driver and data storage.\nAfter completing the parsing process, the script stops the WebDriver and saves the collected comments into a DataFrame. The data is exported to an Excel file.",
